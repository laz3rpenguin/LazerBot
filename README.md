# LazerBot
Welcome to the **GitHub** page for **LazerBot**.
LazerBot is a **Discord Bot** written in **Node JS** and **Discord.js**.
LazerBot is developed by me, **Lazer** and you can check me out on Discord here: **Lazer#9644**.
LazerBot is fully **self-hostable** and a guide will be published soon on how to do that.

Finally, a big thanks to KingDGrizzle for letting my base the bot off of one of his bots. You can check him out here: https://github.com/KingDGrizzle/
